                    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                    <p class="content_wording">Well, let's see. First the Earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came,
                        but they got too big and fat,
                        so they all died and they turned into oil.</p>
                    <p class="content_wording">Then the renaissance happened, and people started making pizza. Or maybe it happened in 
                        China years earlier, but they didn’t get much credit for it. Maybe that was because it predates the concept of 
                        delivery drivers and wasn’t as popular as it is now. Or maybe it was even further in the past before delivery drivers 
                        were even a thing? We lost track. But what we do know, is that people have been putting whatever they wanted on top of dough and baking it.</p>
                    <p class="content_wording">Anyway, years later a guy named Dave, ended up making a pizza place
                        in
                        downtown Corvallis.
                        And along the way he was really hoping the story would be long enough for the scroll box on
                        the about page to actually scroll some place.</p>
